Woolgathering
Eric Nahe and Tobias Boyd

Herd sheep and make wool in this fast paced puzzle game designed to teach fractional representations to elementary school students! Make groups of sheep that represent a fraction to get points. Try to make as many groups as you can before time runs out!
Many students get stuck when trying to depict fractions as a single object divided into parts, especially with fractions with odd-number denominators. These fractions can be easier to draw as a subgroup of a group of objects. Our goal is that after playing Woolgathering, students will be able to depict a fraction in this way.

Instructions:
Left click on a sheep to select it. 
When you think your selection matches the fraction, right-click it to remove it.
Sheep are replaced and fraction is regenerated.
Try to make as many matches as you can before time runs out!
